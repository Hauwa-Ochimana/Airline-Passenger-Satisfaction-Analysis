### Analysis
1. Travel Type Impact: Business travelers report higher satisfaction compared to personal travelers. Dissatisfaction is more pronounced among personal travelers, particularly when flights are delayed.
2. Flight Delays: Major delays in flight arrival increase dissatisfaction to 64%, showing delays are the strongest driver of dissatisfaction.
3. Returning Customers: While returning customers make up the majority (106K), their dissatisfaction is concerning, indicating potential loyalty risks.
4. Age Distribution: Mature and older passengers contribute disproportionately to dissatisfaction, while younger travelers show slightly higher satisfaction.
5. Seat Class Trends: Premium and business class passengers report higher satisfaction, highlighting expectations based on service level.
6. Percentage Measures: The satisfaction rate represents the proportion of passengers who are satisfied, while the dissatisfaction rate reflects the passengers who are neutral or dissatisfied.
7. Insights: Combining demographics, travel type, and arrival flight delay shows that delays for loyal business travelers and older passengers are the most critical areas to address. Minor delays have a smaller impact on first-time or younger travelers, suggesting targeted operational improvements can maximize impact.

### Conclusion
The airlineâ€™s overall satisfaction rate is low (43%), with arrival flight delay (which is the same as departure flight delay) as the primary driver of dissatisfaction. Loyal, returning customers and older passengers are most affected, posing long-term retention risks. The analysis highlights key areas for operational improvement, loyalty programs, and customer focused interventions.

- Customer Recovery Strategy: Offer proactive compensation and clear communication for delayed flights to improve perception and satisfaction.
- Loyalty Retention: Focus on business travelers and returning customers with tailored perks, faster check-ins, and personalized services.
- Targeted Interventions by Age Group: Address concerns of older passengers with dedicated support, seating comfort, and communication.
- Data-driven Monitoring: Track satisfaction monthly by route, travel type, customer class, and age group to identify emerging trends.
- Predictive Planning: Use historical delay and satisfaction data to anticipate high-risk flights and proactively mitigate issues.
- Employee Training: Enhance crew training on handling delays and customer concerns to reduce negative experiences.
